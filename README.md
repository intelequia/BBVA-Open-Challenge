# BBVA-Open-Challenge
This repo is a start-up guide to help developers of BBVA's Open Challenge to prepare their Mixed Reality (MR) projects using Microsoft holographic technology.
The aim of the developers is to design a MR solution to improve the work space of the trader of the future.
But developing high quality MR projects requires prior knowledge such as:
•	Animation, lighting and modeling of 3D objects.
•	Scheduling scenes with Unity3D.
And also some experience with Hololens, the hardware device Head Mounted Display (HMD) designed by the Microsoft team.
For this reason the organization of the event has decided to democratize the contest allowing the developers to do their projects using only the emulator and later providing them a Hololens for their presentation in Chicago. This prevents the developer from having the Hololens hardware, which is currently in a development phase, with a high price and geographical limitation for its distribution.
 This guide, therefore, collects in an organized way the basic procedures and techniques necessary to successfully execute a MR project in the Hololens simulator provided in the latest versions of Microsoft Visual Studio.
Finally, you can note that this guide has been developed by Intelequia VR Team. Any doubts or clarifications that contestants have about the procedures described can direct it to the mailbox of technical support hololens@intelequia.com, indicating in the body of the same the data of registry of the contestant.
